If I want to commit only the updated PDF then

git commit vitae.pdf -F .tmp.git

will do it, otherwise the -am will only update the .qmd file (I think?) if physically it has been altered beyond the time stamp (? assumption on my part, but seems to be the case)

socialsciences no longer exists, figured out how to host pdf on github pages, all good...

1. Create repo (vitae)
2. Create pages site with main
3. Link to https://jeffreyracine.github.io/vitae/vitae.pdf (or HTML)
